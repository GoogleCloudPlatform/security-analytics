# 6.15 - List all IP addresses with any associated entities
List all IP addresses, including the time window each address was seen in the VPC Flow logs,
a nested list of all other IP addresses it connected to, and the total volume of
inbound/outbound traffic. Default lookback window is 60 days.

For IP addresses associated with internal entities (e.g. VM or GKE node), return corresponding
metadata as well. For example, if an IP address belongs to a VM instance, return VM name
and VPC name if available.
