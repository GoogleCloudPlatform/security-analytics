# 1.30 - Cloud Console accesses
List Cloud Console accesses and approximate user sessions over time grouped by
user, user agent and IP address. This query helps you audit who's accessing
Cloud Console and from where. This query relies primarily on audited 'GetProject'
actions as a proxy for a login event. Therefore:
**Data Access logs (ADMIN_READ) for Cloud Resource Manager API must be enabled**
on all your projects.

A 'GetProject' action is executed as part of every successful login event,
whether it's from Cloud Console, gcloud CLI or cloud SDKs including third-party
tools like Terraform. The specific channel is not recorded in the audit log, but is
rather inferred by this query based on the user agent.

Note the following limitations:
- This audit query only returns successful Console accesses. No audit logs are
generated when a user doesn't have the right permissions to load the page.
- This audit query does not return discrete login events, but **approximate**
session times as user navigates through Cloud Console pages.
- This audit query does not return specific page or resources accessed since these
details are not captured in the audit logs.
